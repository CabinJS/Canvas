# Canvas
> Starter theme for [Cabin](http://cabinjs.com)

## Installation

To use Canvas you must have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/) (for [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)), and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) installed.

First install Cabin and Grunt globally with this command:

```bash
npm install -g cabin grunt-cli
```

Then scaffold a static site generator using the Canvas theme with this command:

```bash
cabin new blog CabinJS/Canvas
```

Now change into the `blog` directory and run the `grunt` command: 

```bash
cd blog && grunt
```

This will build your site, start a static file server, open a browser tab with the site's homepage, and start a watch process to rebuild your site when source files change.

Try editing a markdown file in the `posts` folder or css in the `src/styles` folder and upon saving, your site will automatically be rebuilt with the updated content/styles. When you edit markdown, your browser will automatically refresh to view new content, and when editing styles, they will be injected directly into the page for an immediate update.

**Note: In the future, you can build your site by running the `grunt` command in the `blog` folder.**
